# Atomus TAM Research & Scoring System

## Overview

GTM Intelligence Agent for Atomus, focused exclusively on defense contractors who require NIST 800-171 and CMMC compliance solutions. The system identifies, researches, scores, and prioritizes defense contractors based on their potential need for Atomus's cybersecurity compliance services.

## 🚀 Current Implementation Status

### 🔄 IN PROGRESS

**Web Research Module:**
- ❌ `web_research.py` - Not yet implemented (ethical web scraping component)

**Testing Organization:**
- ⚠️ Test files exist in root but need to be moved to `tests/` directory
- ⚠️ Jupyter notebooks planned but not yet created

**HubSpot Structure:**
- ⚠️ Custom properties setup implemented but needs validation in production

## 🧪 Testing Results

**Integration Test Status:**
- ✅ All API connections verified working
- ✅ Complete workflow tested: HigherGov → OpenAI → Scoring → HubSpot
- ✅ Successfully processed test companies: Firestorm, Firehawk, Overland AI
- ✅ HubSpot custom properties setup and sync working
- ✅ Scoring algorithm operational with tier classification

**Test Companies Successfully Processed:**
- Firestorm, Firehawk, Overland AI (integration tested)
- Full dataset: American Maglev Technologies, Matsys, H3X, Compass Technologies Group, Martian Sky, Orbital Composites, Hybron Technologies, Image Insight, Force Engineering, Kform (ready for testing)

## Core Features

### Scoring Algorithm
- **Weighted Scoring System**: Defense Contract Score (35%) + Technology Relevance (30%) + Compliance Indicators (25%) + Firmographics (10%)
- **Keyword-Based Scoring**: Primary (10pts), Secondary (7pts), and Specialized (10pts) keywords
- **Tier Classification**: 
  - Tier 1 (90-100): Immediate outreach priority
  - Tier 2 (75-89): High-value prospects  
  - Tier 3 (60-74): Qualified prospects
  - Tier 4 (45-59): Nurture candidates

### API Integrations
- **HubSpot**: Custom properties for Atomus scoring, automated company/contact sync
- **OpenAI**: Configurable research prompts, AI-powered company analysis
- **HigherGov**: Defense contractor verification, contract history analysis
